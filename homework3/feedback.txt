Homework Feedback for Cat App with Mongoose:

Functionality:

All of the required features work!
The createToy function does not work because toys is a property of each cat within allCats,
not a property of allCats.  If you want to try out embedding again, you will probably know how to do this now! Nice job trying out an additional/challenging feature. Your advanced query was functional.

The only bugs were in the additional challenges portion of the assignment, so you will not lose any points for those.

Completion:  (20/20)
Bug Free: (10/10)

Quality:

You followed good coding practices throughout! Your code was very readable. 
It looks like you forgot to put a comment explaining what the gteCat function does, and spacing could be a little more consistent. 

Good Coding Practices: (10/10)
Readability: (9/10)


Summary:
Nice work! Your advanced query worked and it was awesome to start trying out something more challenging. You had a great handle on how to integrate the mongo database!
